# Optimization-Solver
A unconstrained optimization solver and a constrained optimization sovler

Built a unconstrained optimization solver:
1. Implement steepest descent algorithm, Newton's method and quasi-Newton's methods including Broyden family  and Alternate Broyden family.  
Implemented different line search algorithm including Armijoâ€™s rule, dichotomous search, bisection search, Fibonacci search, golden search.

Built a constrained optimization solver:
1. Implemented barrier method, penalty method, augmented Lagrangian method, and successive quadratic programming (SQP) including rudimentary SQP (RSQP), SQP-BFGS, merit SQP (MSQP).
